## About

This is a quick and dirty example of how to incorporate React's built-in context into a simple application.

## Getting Started

Just run the following commands to start the app:

```
npm i
npm start
```

## How It Works

Just click the 'Sign Up' link at the top right of the page, then enter any username and password in the fields and click the Sign Up button.

Next, click the 'Sign In' link at the top right of the page, then enter the username and password you previously entered to sign up and click the Sign In button.

You should notice that the header and footer change colors, and that the text 'Welcome, {username}!' appear in the top right, with an option to Sign Out.
